## 1. Why did we create Ares?

We looked, and we didn't find any good Habbo Retro CMS out there.

All of them were either crappy coded, outdated or just didn't have the Features they Promised.

We want to create something useful, fun to use and at the same time extremely fast.

## 2. Why Ares?

Ares is using state-of-the-art Technology to make the experience for you and your Users as secure, fast and convenient as possible.

We're always updating Ares with new Features and try to keep it Bug-Free.

Ares is here to stay.
